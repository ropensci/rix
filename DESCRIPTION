Description: Simplifies the creation of reproducible data science environments
    using the 'Nix' package manager, as described in
    Dolstra (2006) <ISBN 90-393-4130-3>. The included `rix()`
    function generates a complete description of the environment as a
    `default.nix` file, which can then be built using 'Nix'. This results in
    project specific software environments with pinned versions of R, packages,
    linked system dependencies, and other tools. Additional helpers make it easy
    to run R code in 'Nix' software environments for testing and production.
