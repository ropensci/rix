#' Generate a Nix expression that builds a reproducible development environment
#' @return Nothing, this function only has the side-effect of writing two files:
#'   `default.nix` and `.Rprofile` in the working directory. `default.nix`
#'   contains a Nix expression to build a reproducible environment using the Nix
#'   package manager, and `.Rprofile` ensures that a running R session from a
#'   Nix environment cannot access local libraries, nor install packages using
#'   `install.packages()` (nor remove nor update them).
#' @param r_ver Character. The required R version, for example "4.0.0". You can
#'   check which R versions are available using `available_r()`, and for more
#'   details check `available_df()`. For reproducibility purposes, you can also
#'   provide a `nixpkgs` revision directly. For older versions of R, `nix-build`
#'   might fail with an error stating 'this derivation is not meant to be
#'   built'. In this case, simply drop into the shell with `nix-shell` instead
#'   of building it first. It is also possible to provide either "bleeding-edge"
#'   or "frozen-edge" if you need an environment with bleeding edge packages.
#'   Read more in the "Details" section below.
#' @param date Character. Instead of providing `r_ver`, it is also possible to
#'   provide a date. This will build an environment containing R and R packages
#'   (and other dependencies) as of that date. You can check which dates are
#'   available with `available_dates()`. For more details about versions check
#'   `available_df()`.
#' @param r_pkgs Vector of characters. List the required R packages for your
#'   analysis here.
#' @param system_pkgs Vector of characters. List further software you wish to
#'   install that are not R packages such as command line applications for
#'   example. You can look for available software on the NixOS website
#'   \url{https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=}
#' @param git_pkgs List. A list of packages to install from Git. See details for
#'   more information.
#' @param local_r_pkgs Vector of characters, paths to local packages to install.
#'   These packages need to be in the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` formats and must be in
#'   the same folder as the generated "default.nix" file.
#' @param tex_pkgs Vector of characters. A set of TeX packages to install. Use
#'   this if you need to compile `.tex` documents, or build PDF documents using
#'   Quarto. If you don't know which package to add, start by adding "amsmath".
#'   See the
#'   `vignette("d2- installing-system-tools-and-texlive-packages-in-a-nix-environment")`
#'   for more details.
#' @param py_conf List. A list containing two elements: `py_version` and
#'   `py_pkgs`. `py_version` should be in the form `"3.12"` for Python 3.12, and
#'   `py_pkgs` should be an atomic vector of package names (e.g., `py_pkgs =
#'   c("polars", "plotnine", "great-tables")`). If Python packages are requested
#'   but `{reticulate}` is not in the list of R packages, the user will be
#'   warned that they may want to add it. When `py_conf` packages are requested,
#'   the `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable is set to ensure the Nix
#'   environment does not use with a system-wide Python installation.
#' @param jl_conf List. A list of two elements, `jl_version` and `jl_conf`.
#'   `jl_version` must be of the form `"1.10"` for Julia 1.10. Leave empty or
#'   use an empty string to use the latest version, or use `"lts"` for the long
#'   term support version. `jl_conf` must be an atomic vector of packages names,
#'   for example `jl_conf = c("TidierData", "TidierPlots")`.
#' @param ide Character, defaults to "none". If you wish to use RStudio to work
#'   interactively use "rstudio" or "rserver" for the server version. Use "code"
#'   for Visual Studio Code or "codium" for Codium, or "positron" for Positron.
#'   You can also use "radian", an interactive REPL. This will install a
#'   project-specific version of the chosen editor which will be differrent than
#'   the one already present in your system (if any). For other editors or if
#'   you want to use an editor already installed on your system (which will
#'   require some configuration to make it work seamlessly with Nix shells see
#'   the `vignette("e-configuring-ide")` for configuration examples), use
#'   "none". Please be aware that VS Code and Positron are not free software. To
#'   facilitate their installation, `rix()` automatically enables a required
#'   setting without prompting the user for confirmation. See the "Details"
#'   section below for more information.
#' @param project_path Character, where to write `default.nix`, for example
#'   "/home/path/to/project". The file will thus be written to the file
#'   "/home/path/to/project/default.nix". If the folder does not exist, it will
#'   be created.
#' @param overwrite Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, overwrite the
#'   `default.nix` file in the specified path.
#' @param print Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, print `default.nix` to
#'   console.
#' @param message_type Character. Message type, defaults to `"simple"`, which
#'   gives minimal but sufficient feedback. Other values are currently
#'   `"quiet`, which generates the files without message, and `"verbose"`, displays all the messages.
#' @param shell_hook Character of length 1, defaults to `NULL`. Commands added
#'   to the `shellHook` variable are executed when the Nix shell starts. So by
#'   default, using `nix-shell default.nix` will start a specific program,
#'   possibly with flags (separated by space), and/or do shell actions. You can
#'   for example use `shell_hook = R`, if you want to directly enter the
#'   declared Nix R session when dropping into the Nix shell.
#' @param ignore_remotes_cache Logical, defaults to FALSE. This variable is only
#'   needed when adding packages from GitHub with remote dependencies, it can be
#'   ignored otherwise. If `TRUE`, the cache of already processed GitHub remotes
#'   will be ignored and all packages will be processed. If `FALSE`, the cache
#'   will be used to skip already processed packages, which makes use of fewer
#'   API calls. Setting this argument to `TRUE` can be useful for debugging.
#' @details This function will write a `default.nix` and an `.Rprofile` in the
#'   chosen path. Using the Nix package manager, it is then possible to build a
#'   reproducible development environment using the `nix-build` command in the
#'   path. This environment will contain the chosen version of R and packages,
#'   and will not interfere with any other installed version (via Nix or not) on
#'   your machine. Every dependency, including both R package dependencies but
#'   also system dependencies like compilers will get installed as well in that
#'   environment.
#'
#'   It is possible to use environments built with Nix interactively, either
#'   from the terminal, or using an interface such as RStudio. If you want to
#'   use RStudio, set the `ide` argument to `"rstudio"`. Please be aware that
#'   for macOS, RStudio is only available starting from R version 4.4.3 or from
#'   the 2025-02-28. As such, you may want to use another editor on macOS if you
#'   need to use an environment with an older version of R. To use Visual Studio
#'   Code (or Codium), set the `ide` argument to `"code"` or `"codium"`
#'   respectively, which will add the `{languageserver}` R package to the list
#'   of R packages to be installed by Nix in that environment. It is also
#'   possible to use Positron by setting the `ide` argument to `"positron"`.
#'   Setting the `ide` argument to an editor will install it from Nix, meaning
#'   that each of your projects can have a dedicated IDE (or IDE version).
#'   `"radian"` and `"rserver"` are also options.
#'
#'   Instead of using Nix to install an IDE, you can also simply use the one you
#'   have already installed on your system, with the exception of RStudio which
#'   must be managed by Nix to "see" Nix environments. Positron must also be
#'   heavily configured to work with Nix shells, so we recommend installing it
#'   using Nix. To use an editor that you already have installed on your system,
#'   set `ide = "none"` and refer to the `vignette("e-configuring-ide")` for
#'   more details on how to set up your editor to work with Nix shells.
#'
#'   Packages to install from GitHub or Gitlab must be provided in a list of 3
#'   elements: "package_name", "repo_url" and "commit". To install several
#'   packages, provide a list of lists of these 3 elements, one per package to
#'   install. It is also possible to install old versions of packages by
#'   specifying a version. For example, to install the latest version of `{AER}`
#'   but an old version of `{ggplot2}`, you could write: `r_pkgs = c("AER",
#'   "ggplot2@2.2.1")`. Note however that doing this could result in dependency
#'   hell, because an older version of a package might need older versions of
#'   its dependencies, but other packages might need more recent versions of the
#'   same dependencies. If instead you want to use an environment as it would
#'   have looked at the time of `{ggplot2}`'s version 2.2.1 release, then use
#'   the Nix revision closest to that date, by setting `r_ver = "3.1.0"`, which
#'   was the version of R current at the time. This ensures that Nix builds a
#'   completely coherent environment. For security purposes, users that wish to
#'   install packages from GitHub/GitLab or from the CRAN archives must provide
#'   a security hash for each package. `{rix}` automatically precomputes this
#'   hash for the source directory of R packages from GitHub/Gitlab or from the
#'   CRAN archives, to make sure the expected trusted sources that match the
#'   precomputed hashes in the `default.nix` are downloaded, but only if Nix
#'   is installed. If you need to generate an expression with such packages,
#'   but are working on a system where you can't install Nix, consider generating
#'   the expression using a continuous integration service, such as GitHub
#'   Actions.
#'
#'   Note that installing packages from Git or old versions using the `"@"`
#'   notation or local packages, does not leverage Nix's capabilities for
#'   dependency solving. As such, you might have trouble installing these
#'   packages. If that is the case, open an issue on `{rix}`'s GitHub
#'   repository.
#'
#'   If GitHub packages have dependencies on GitHub as well, `{rix}` will
#'   attempt to generate the correct expression, but we highly recommend you
#'   read the
#'   `vignette("z-advanced-topic-handling-packages-with-remote-dependencies")`
#'   Vignette.
#'
#'   By default, the Nix shell will be configured with `"en_US.UTF-8"` for the
#'   relevant locale variables (`LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_TIME`, `LC_MONETARY`,
#'   `LC_PAPER`, `LC_MEASUREMENT`). This is done to ensure locale
#'   reproducibility by default in Nix environments created with `rix()`. If
#'   there are good reasons to not stick to the default, you can set your
#'   preferred locale variables via `options(rix.nix_locale_variables =
#'   list(LANG = "de_CH.UTF-8", <...>)` and the aforementioned locale variable
#'   names.
#'
#'   It is possible to use `"bleeding-edge`" or `"frozen-edge`" as the value for
#'   the `r_ver` argument. This will create an environment with the very latest
#'   R packages. `"bleeding-edge`" means that every time you will build the
#'   environment, the packages will get updated. This is especially useful for
#'   environments that need to be constantly updated, for example when
#'   developing a package. In contrast, `"frozen-edge`" will create an
#'   environment that will remain stable at build time. So if you create a
#'   `default.nix` file using `"bleeding-edge`", each time you build it using
#'   `nix-build` that environment will be up-to-date. With `"frozen-edge`" that
#'   environment will be up-to-date on the date that the `default.nix` will be
#'   generated, and then each subsequent call to `nix-build` will result in the
#'   same environment. `"bioc-devel"` is the same as `"bleeding-edge"`, but also
#'   adds the development version of Bioconductor. `"r-devel"` is the same as
#'   bleeding edge, but with the R development version instead of the latest
#'   stable version and `"r-devel-bioc-devel"` is the same as `"r-devel"` but
#'   with Bioconductor on the development version. We highly recommend you read
#'   the vignette titled
#'   "z - Advanced topic: Understanding the rPackages set release cycle and
#'   using bleeding edge packages".
