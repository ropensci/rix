## The Nix package manager

Nix is a package manager that can be installed on your computer (regardless of
OS) and can be used to install software like with any other package manager. If
you're familiar with the Ubuntu Linux distribution, you likely have used
`apt-get` to install software. On macOS, you may have used `homebrew` for
similar purposes. Nix functions in a similar way, but has many advantages over
classic package managers. The main advantage of Nix, at least for our purposes,
is that its repository of software is huge. As of writing, it contains more than
80.000 packages, and the entirety of CRAN and Bioconductor is available through
Nix's repositories. This means that using Nix, it is possible to install not
only R, but also all the packages required for your project. The obvious
question is why use Nix instead of simply installing R and R packages as usual.
The answer is that Nix makes sure to install every dependency of any package, up
to required system libraries. For example, the `{xlsx}` package requires the
Java programming language to be installed on your computer to successfully
install. This can be difficult to achieve, and `{xlsx}` bullied many R
developers throughout the years (especially those using a Linux distribution,
`sudo R CMD javareconf` still plagues my nightmares). But with Nix, it suffices
to declare that we want the `{xlsx}` package for our project, and Nix figures
out automatically that Java is required and installs and configures it. It all
just happens without any required intervention from the user. The second
advantage of Nix is that it is possible to *pin* a certain *revision* of the Nix
packages' repository (called `nixpkgs`) for our project. Pinning a revision
ensures that every package that Nix installs will always be at exactly the same
versions, regardless of when in the future the packages get installed.


## rix workflow

The idea of `{rix}` is for you to declare the environment you need using the
provided `rix()` function. `rix()` is the package’s main function and generates
a file called `default.nix` which is then used by the Nix package manager to
build that environment. Ideally, you would set up such an environment for each
of your projects. You can then use this environment to either work
interactively, or run R scripts. It is possible to have as many environments as
projects, and software that is common to environments will simply be re-used and
not get re-installed to save space. Environments are isolated for each other,
but can still interact with your system's files, unlike with Docker where a
volume must be mounted. Environments can also interact with the software
installed on your computer through the usual means, which can sometimes lead to
issues. We have provided functions and documentation to avoid this, so take your
time read through the vignettes and you should be fine.

`rix()` has several arguments:

- the R version you need for your project;
- a list of R packages that your project needs;
- an optional list of additional software (for example a Python interpreter, or Quarto);
- an optional list with packages to install from Github;
- an optional list of LaTeX packages;
- whether you want to use RStudio as an IDE for your project (or VS Code, or another environment);
- the path to save the `default.nix` file (by default the current working directory)

For example:


```{r eval = FALSE}
rix(r_ver = "latest",
    r_pkgs = c("dplyr", "chronicler"),
    ide = "other")
```

The call above writes a `default.nix` file in the current working directory.
This `default.nix` can in turn be used by Nix to build an environment containing
the latest version of R, with the `{dplyr}` and `{chronicler}` packages.

Take note of the `ide = "other"` argument: this argument, and the values it
can take, are further discussed in the vignette `vignette("5-interactive-use")`
but continue reading this vignette and then vignettes numbered by a "4".


### Using default.nix files

The Nix package manager can be used to build reproducible development
environments according to the specifications found in the generated
`default.nix` files, which contain a Nix *expression*. An *expression* is Nix
jargon for a function with multiple inputs and one output, this output being our
development environment. `{rix}` does not require Nix to be installed to
generate valid expressions (but does require an internet connection), so you
could generate expressions and use them on other machines. To actually build an
environment using a `default.nix` file, go to where you chose to write it
(ideally in a new, empty folder that will be the root folder of your project)
and use the Nix package manager to build the environment. Call the following
function in a terminal:

```
nix-build
```

Once Nix is done building the environment, you can start working on it
interactively by using the following command in a terminal emulator (not the R
console):

```
nix-shell
```

You will *drop* into a Nix shell which provides the installed software.

Now that you know more about Nix and `{rix}`, it is time to get these tools
installed on your system.
