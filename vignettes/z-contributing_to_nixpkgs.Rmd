## Introduction

If you want to help us make the R ecosystem better on Nix by fixing packages,
then read on!

This Vignette will help you help us! It lists common ways that packages can
break and teaches you how to fix these R packages for inclusion to `nixpkgs`.
Every package available on CRAN and Bioconductor gets built on Hydra and made
available through the `rPackages` package set. So there's no need to manually
package them. However, some packages don't build successfully, and require
manual fixing. Most of them are very quick, one-line fixes, but others require a
bit more work. The goal of this Vignette is to make you quickly familiar with
the main reasons a package may be broken and explain to you how to fix it, and
why certain packages get fixed in certain ways.

This vignette assumes that you are comfortable with Git and with the concepts
of branches and PRs (pull requests) and with compiling software on Linux.

## Setting up

We first need to set up some thing. Fork the [`nixpkgs` repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)
and clone it to your computer. Then, add the original repository as a remote:

```
git checkout master

# Add upstream as a remote
git remote add upstream git@github.com:NixOS/nixpkgs.git
```

This way, each time you want to fix a package, you can fetch the latest updates
from upstream and merge them to your local copy:

```
# Fetch latest updates
git fetch upstream

# Merge latest upstream/master to your master
git merge upstream/master
```

Make sure to merge the latest commits from upstream regularly, because `nixpkgs`
gets updated very frequently each day. We can now look for a package to fix.

If for some reason you cannot update your local copy, make sure you're on `master`
and reset hard:

```
git reset --hard upstream/master
```

Always make sure to create a new branch to fix a package, don't work from `master`,
you'll just be asking for trouble!

You might also want to join our Matrix chat room to coordinate efforts. You can
join it [here](https://matrix.to/#/#r:nixos.org).

## Where to find packages to fix

The first step to help fix a package is to find a package to fix: you should
visit the latest `rPackages` evaluation over
[here](https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/nixpkgs/r-updates). Click on the "Still
failing jobs" tab to see which packages' builds didn't succeed and click on a
package. You should see something like this:

![AIUQ build steps](images/AIUQ_failing.png)

From there, you can see that `{AIUQ}`'s build failed because of another package,
`{SuperGauss}`, so fixing `{SuperGauss}` will likely fix this one as well.

You can look for `{SuperGauss}` in the "Still failing jobs" tab, and see why
`{SuperGauss}` failed, or you could check out a little dashboard I built that
you can find
[here](https://raw.githack.com/b-rodrigues/nixpkgs-r-updates-fails/targets-runs/output/r-updates-fails.html).
This dashboard shows essentially the same information you find on the "Still
failing jobs" tab from before, but with several added niceties. First of all,
there's a column called `fails_because_of` that shows the name of the package
that caused another to fail. So in our example with `{AIUQ}`, `{SuperGauss}`
would be listed there (if a package fails for another reason, like a missing
system-level dependency, then its own name is listed there). You can type
`{SuperGauss}` on the little box there to filter and see all the packages that
fail because of of it. Then, you can also see the package's *package rank*. This
rank is computed using the `{packageRank}` package, and the table is sorted by
lowest rank (low ranks indicate high popularity and there's also the
`percentile` column that indicates the percentage of packages with higher
downloads). Finally, there's a direct link to a PR fixing the package (if it has
been opened) and also the PR's status: has it been merged already or not?

Having a link to the PR is quite useful, because it immediately tells you if
someone already tried fixing it. If the PR has been merged, simply try to another
fix package. If the PR is open and not yet merged, this is a great
opportunity to help review it (more on that below)!

Let's go back to fixing `{SuperGauss}`. If you go back on Hydra, you can see the
error message that was thrown during building:

![Check out the logfile](images/SuperGauss_log.png)

Click on the logfile (either `pretty`, `raw` or `tail`) to see what happened.
Here's what we see:

```
checking for pkg-config... no
checking for FFTW... configure: error: in `/build/SuperGauss':
configure: error: The pkg-config script could not be found or is too old.  Make sure it
is in your PATH or set the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to the full
path to pkg-config.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables FFTW_CFLAGS
and FFTW_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.

To get pkg-config, see <http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/>.
See `config.log' for more details
ERROR: configuration failed for package 'SuperGauss'
* removing '/nix/store/jxv5p85x24xmfcnifw2ibvx9jhk9f2w4-r-SuperGauss-2.0.3/library/SuperGauss'
```

So the issue is that some system-level dependencies are missing, `pkg-config`
and `FFTW`, so we need to add these to fix the build. Which brings us the
first recipe of this cookbook!

## Case 1: packages that need dependencies to build

Fixing packages that require system-level dependencies is a matter of adding
one, maybe two lines, in the right place in the expression that defines the
whole of the `rPackages` set. You can find this file
[here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/r-modules/default.nix).

In there, you will find a line that starts with `packagesWithNativeBuildInputs = {`
and another that starts with `packagesWithBuildInputs = {` which define a
long list of packages. The difference between `NativeBuildInputs` and
`BuildInputs` is that dependencies that are needed for compilation get listed
into `NativeBuildInputs` (so things like compilers and packages such as
`pkg-config`) and dependencies that are needed at run-time (dynamic libraries)
get listed under `BuildInputs`. For R, actually, you could put everything under
`NativeBuildInputs` and it would still work, but we try to pay attention to this
and do it properly. In case of doubt, put everything under `NativeBuildInputs`:
when reviewing your PR, people will then tell you where to put what.

Before doing anything else, try to build the package. The following line will
drop you in an interactive Nix shell with the package if build succeeds (run the
command at the root of the cloned `nixpkgs` directory):

```
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=. -p R rPackages.SuperGauss
```

if you see the same error as on Hydra, and made sure that no PR is opened, then
you can start fixing the package.

So, we need to add two dependencies. Let's read the relevant lines in the error
message again:

```
configure: error: The pkg-config script could not be found or is too old.  Make sure it
is in your PATH or set the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to the full
path to pkg-config.

Alternatively, you may set the environment variables FFTW_CFLAGS
and FFTW_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man page for more details.
```

If you look in the `default.nix` file, in particular the two lists that define
the packages that need `nativeBuildInputs` and `buildInputs`, you'll see that
many of them have `pkg-config` listed there already. So let's add the following
line in the `packagesWithNativeBuildInputs`

```
SuperGauss = [ pkgs.pkg-config ];
```

and this one under `packagesWithBuildInputs`:

```
SuperGauss = [ pkgs.fftw.dev ];
```

This is because `pkg-config` is only needed to compile `{SuperGauss}` and
`fftw.dev` is needed at run-time as well.

Try to build a shell with `{SuperGauss}` again:

```
nix-shell -I nixpkgs=. -p R rPackages.SuperGauss
```

If it worked, start R and load the library. Sometimes packages can build
successfully but fail to launch, so taking the time to load them avoids wasting
your reviewer's time. Ideally, try to run one or several examples from the
package's vignette or help files. This also makes sure that everything is
working properly. If your testing succeeded, you can now open a PR!

Before committing, make sure that you are on a seprate branch for this fix (you
can do your changes on `master` as long as you don't commit and change branch):

```
git checkout -b fix_supergauss
```

From there, make sure that only the `default.nix` file changed:

```
git status
```

```
user@computer:~/Documents/nixpkgs(fix_supergauss *)$ git status
On branch fix_supergaus
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   pkgs/development/r-modules/default.nix

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Sometimes, running examples may produce files, so if that's the case get rid of
them. No files added in this case so add `default.nix` to the commit and write
following commit message:

```
git add .
git commit -m "rPackages.SuperGauss: fixed build"
```

This commit message follows `nixpkgs`'s [contributing guidelines](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixpkgs/Contributing).
Format all your messages like this.

Now push your changes:

```
git push origin fix_supergauss
```

and go on your fork's repository to open a PR.

Congratulations, you fixed your first package!

## Case 2: packages that need a home, X, or simple patching

Some package may require a `/home` directory during their installation process. They
usually fail with a message that looks like this:

```
Warning in normalizePath("~") :
  path[1]="/homeless-shelter": No such file or directory
```

so add the package to the list named `packagesRequiringHome` and try rebuilding.

See this PR as an example: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/292336

Some packages require `X`, as in `X11`, the windowing system on Linux
distributions. In other words, these pacakges must be installed on a machine
with a graphical session running. Because that's not the case on Hydra, this
needs to be mocked. Simply add the package to the list named
`packagesRequiringX` and try rebuilding.

See this PR https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/292347 for an example.

Finally, some packages that must be compiled need first to be configured. This
is a common step when compiling software. This configuration step ensures that
needed dependencies are found (among other things). Because Nix works the way it
does, it can happen that this configuration step fails because dependencies are
not in the usual `/usr/bin` or `/bin`, etc, paths. So this needs to be patched
before the configuration step. To fix this, the `configuration` file that lists
the different dependencies to be found needs to be patched, and this can be done
by overriding one of the phases before the configure phase. We override the
`postPatch` phase like this:

```
RcppCGAL = old.RcppCGAL.overrideAttrs (attrs: {
  postPatch = "patchShebangs configure";
});
```

Read more about `patchShebangs`
[here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/build-support/setup-hooks/patch-shebangs.sh).

See this PR for an example: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/289775

Sometimes patching is a bit more complicated. See this other example
[here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/291258).

## Case 3: packages that require their attributes to be overridden

Staying on the topic of overrides, it can also happen that packages need one or
more of their attributes to be overridden. This is already much more complex
than the cases from before, because the error messages that may hint at which
attributes to override can be much more cryptic. For example, here's the build
log of `{xslt}`:

```

ERROR: compilation failed for package 'xslt'
* removing '/nix/store/1p4qp17ccjvi53g3vl67j3z8n1lp61m3-r-xslt-1.4.4/library/xslt'
```

The only hint in there is that url pointing to `gcc`'s manual entry on the
`-fpermissive` flag. What happened is that code raises some warning during
compilation: without this flag, the warning gets turned into an error. So we
need to add this flag during compilation to "tolerate" the warning. Here's how
this was done for `{xslt}`:

```
xslt = old.xslt.overrideAttrs (attrs: {
  env = (attrs.env or { }) // {
    NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE = attrs.env.NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE + " -fpermissive";
  };
});
```

So the attribute we override is the `NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE` attribute. We
add `-fpermissive` to the other flags and we're good to go.

Check out this PR for the complete `{xlst} example: `https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/292329

Also take some time to read other examples of overrides in the `default.nix`
file to learn about other common attributes that could need to be overridden.

## Case 4: packages that need a dependency that must be overridden

Sometimes it is not the attribute of a package that needs to be overriden, but
one of its dependencies.

For example, the `{opencv}` R packages requires the `opencv` software to be compiled
using a specific configuration option `enableGtk2 = true`. However, the version
of `opencv` available on `nixpkgs` doesn't have this flag set to `true`. But that's not
an issue, since we can override it.

See this [PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/293081) to see how this was done.

Another interesting example is this
[PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/291004) fixing `{hdf5r}`. Even though
it was not merged in the end, I still think that you should study it, as the
solution that was tried is quite instructive!

Finally, there's [this other example fixing `{arrow}`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/294933).
The included comment explains what's happening quite well so I won't rewrite it here.

## Case 5: darwin-specific fixes

Darwin (or macOS) may require some specific fixes for some packages to work. I won't detail
them here, as I don't own the required hardware, but you can look through the
`pkgs/development/r-modules/default.nix` file for darwin-specific fixes. Look for the "darwin"
string to find several examples.

## Case 6: an R packages requires software not in nixpkgs (or outdated in nixpkgs)

Some R packages depend on other software to function. For instance, `{RQuantlib}`
requires `quantlib` which was outdated on `nixpkgs` and leading to build failure.

In [this PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/300087), you'll see that first
`quantlib` got updated, and then `{RQuantlib}` fixed.

Another example: `{Rsymphony}` required the `Symphony` optimizer to be
available, which was completely missing from `nixpkgs`. In [this other
example](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/305301), you'll see that
`Symphony` was added to `nixpkgs` and then `{RSymphony}` was fixed

## Study! Study! Study! Study!

The best way to learn, is to read what has already been done by others. While this guide
can hopefully get you started quickly, I highly recommend that you check out
all the PRs that have been opened and merged [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+rPackages).
As stated already, don't hesitate to join our Matrix channel [here](https://matrix.to/#/#r:nixos.org)
if you need help to get started!

## Broken packages

Finally, there are packages that are "broken". These are packages that
absolutely require something to function that Nix cannot easily provide: for
instance, some packages must connect to the internet to download stuff during
installation time. Because building with Nix happens in a sandbox to ensure
purity, these packages cannot work, unless there is a way to circumvent the need
for a connection. For example, in this
[PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/307071) you will see that it is
possible to download the content required at build time beforehand, so that
installation can still succeed.

Other packages require for example to be linked against proprietary software,
such as `{Rcplex}`. While it should also be possible to fix this package, there
is little incentive to do so as this would require to get an evaluation version
of the software and then fix the package. However, the build would still be
listed as failing on Hydra, as we cannot get that proprietary software (even if
an evaluation version) installed there. Also, this would require quite some
effort to keep maintaining.

To suggest a packages as "broken", add it to the `brokenPackages` list in
[pkgs/development/r-modules/default.nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/r-modules/default.nix).

## Reviewing PRs

To accelerate merging of PRs, it always helps if people review them first! If you
want to help reviewing, you can proceed as follows. First, we highly recommend that
you use the following script put together by [Kupac](https://github.com/kupac):

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

nix-shell -p "radianWrapper.override{packages = with rPackages; [ ${*:2} ];}" \
          -I nixpkgs="https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/archive/$1.tar.gz" --run radian
```

Save that into a file called `rpkg-pr-review` (or whatever you prefer) in your `$PATH` 
(for example, `home/you/bin/`, and make sure  this folder is in your `$PATH`) and make it
executable:

```
chmod +x rpkg-pr-review
```

Find a PR in need of a review. Find the commit ID of the PR:

![Copy the commit ID](images/pr_commit_id.png)

and you can now use it with the script saved before:

```
rpkg-pr-review COMMIT_ID pkg1 pkg2
```

Replace `COMMIT_ID` with the Git commit ID from the PR, and `pkg1` and `pkg2` with the package(s) you
need to review. This will download everything needed and drop you into an interactive `radian` shell
where you can test the packages (if you prefer a standard R shell, replace the `radianWrapper` with
the `rWrapper`, but `radian` is pretty neat, give it a go!)

You can test if the package works, try some examples and so on. You can then also check the fix itself:
do you understand how the fix works? Would you have done it differently? You can make suggestions to the 
committer if you have any. If not, you can also approve the PR from Github’s interface:

![You can leave your review on Github’s interface](images/pr_review.png)
