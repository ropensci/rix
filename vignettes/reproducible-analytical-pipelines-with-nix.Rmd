## Introduction

Isolated environments are great to run pipelines in a safe and reproducible
manner. This vignette details how to build a reproducible analytical pipeline
using an environment built with Nix that contains the right version of R and
packages.


## An example of a reproducible analytical pipeline using Nix

Suppose that I used `{targets}` to build a pipeline for a project and that I did
so using a tailor-made Nix environment. Here is the call to `rix()` that I used
to build that environment:


```{r eval = F}
rix(r_ver = "4.2.2",
    r_pkgs = c("targets", "tarchetypes", "rmarkdown"),
    other_pkgs = NULL,
    git_pkgs = list(package_name = "housing",
                    repo_url = "https://github.com/rap4all/housing/",
                    branch_name = "fusen",
                    commit = "1c860959310b80e67c41f7bbdc3e84cef00df18e"),
    ide = "other",
    path = ".",
    overwrite = TRUE)

```

This call to `rix()` generates the following `default.nix` file:

```

# This file was generated by the {rix} R package on Sat Aug  5 16:43:41 2023

# It uses nixpkgs' revision 8ad5e8132c5dcf977e308e7bf5517cc6cc0bf7d8 for reproducibility purposes

# which will install R version 4.2.2

# Report any issues to https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rix

{ pkgs ? import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/8ad5e8132c5dcf977e308e7bf5517cc6cc0bf7d8.tar.gz") {} }:

  with pkgs;

  let
   my-r = rWrapper.override {
    packages = with rPackages; [
     targets tarchetypes rmarkdown
     (buildRPackage {
         name = "housing";
         src = fetchgit {
           url = "https://github.com/rap4all/housing/";
           branchName = "fusen";
           rev = "1c860959310b80e67c41f7bbdc3e84cef00df18e";
           sha256 = "sha256-s4KGtfKQ7hL0sfDhGb4BpBpspfefBN6hf+XlslqyEn4=";
         };
         propagatedBuildInputs = [
             dplyr ggplot2 janitor purrr readxl rlang rvest stringr tidyr
           ];
      })
     ];
    };
      in
      mkShell {
        LOCALE_ARCHIVE = "${glibcLocales}/lib/locale/locale-archive";
        buildInputs = [
          my-r
          ];
      }

```

The environment that gets built from this `default.nix` file contains R version
4.2.2, the `{targets}` and `{tarchetypes}` packages, as well as the `{housing}`
packages, which is a package that I developing specifically for this project.
Because it is on Github, it gets installed using the `buildRPackage` function
from Nix. I can use this environment to work on my project, or to launch my
`{targets}` pipeline. [This Github
repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/nix_targets_pipeline/tree/master)
contains the finalized project.

If you use `{targets}` you could execute the pipeline in the environment by
running in a terminal:

```
cd /absolute/path/to/housing/ && nix-shell default.nix --run "Rscript -e 'targets::tar_make()'"
```

If you wish to run the pipeline whenever you drop into the Nix shell, you could
add a *Shell-hook* to the generated `default.nix` file:

```
...
      mkShell {
        shellHook = ''
             Rscript -e "targets::tar_make()"
          '';
        LOCALE_ARCHIVE = "${glibcLocales}/lib/locale/locale-archive";
        buildInputs = [
          my-r
          ];
      }


```

Now, each time you drop into the Nix shell for that project using `nix-shell`,
the pipeline gets automatically executed.
