Nix, possible create project-specific environments contain project-specific version R R packages (well tools languages, needed). project-specific environment also include required system-level dependencies can difficult install, GDAL packages geospatial analysis example. Nix installs software: installs software complete “bundle” include dependencies, dependencies’ dependencies . Nix incredibly useful piece software ensuring reproducibility projects, research otherwise. example, allows run web applications like Shiny apps plumber APIs controlled environment, run targets pipelines right version R dependencies, also possible use environments managed Nix work interactively using IDE. essence, means can use rix Nix replace renv Docker one single tool, approach quite different: renv records specific versions individual packages, rix provides complete snapshot R ecosystem specific point time, also snapshots required dependencies make project-specific R environment work. ensure complete reproducibility renv, must combined Docker, order include system-level dependencies (like GDAL, per example ). Nix fairly high entry cost though. Nix complex piece software comes programming language, also called Nix. purpose solve complex problem: defining instructions build software packages manage configurations declarative way. makes sure software gets installed fully reproducible manner, operating system hardware. rix provides functions help write Nix expressions (written Nix language). expressions inputs Nix package manager, build sets software packages provide reproducible development environment. environments can used interactive data analysis, reproduced running pipelines CI/CD systems. Nixpkgs collection includes currently 100.000 pieces software available Nix package manager. rix, can define development environments, shells, contain required tools needed analyze data using R. environments isolated project-specific: means project can use one version R R packages, another environment another version R R packages. However, extra care required already R installed usual method operating system, development environments totally isolated rest system. Unlike Docker, running container acces anything host system, unless explicitely configured , Nix development shells nothing environments add software list already available software (-called PATH). , possible access anything (files software) already present system running Nix shell. Thus, rix also provides function called rix_init() helps isolate R sessions running inside Nix environments rest system. avoids clashes Nix-specific library R packages user library R packages already R installed managed usual method operating system. also possible add software package available Nixpkgs Nix environment, example IDEs RStudio VS Code. Nix R ecosystem currently includes almost entirety CRAN Bioconductor packages (around hundred CRAN Biocondcuctor packages unavailable Nix). Like programming language software, also possible install older releases R packages, install packages GitHub defined states, well local packages .tar.gz format. Nix package manager extremely powerful. handle dependencies package extremely well deterministic manner, also possible reproduce environments containing old releases software. thus possible build environments containing R version 4.0.0 (example) run old project originally developed version R. need tools languages like Python Julia, can also done easily. Nix available Linux, macOS Windows (via WSL2) rix comes following features: define complete development environments code use anywhere; install project-specific complete R environments, can different ; run single R functions (objects call stack) different environment (potentially different R version R packages) interactive R session, get back output function using with_nix(); rix require Nix installed system generate expressions. means can generate expressions system easily install software, use expressions cloud CI/CD environment build project . R installed, can start straight away R session first installing rix: generates file called default.nix path path_default_nix correct expression build environment. build environment, Nix package manager must installed.
